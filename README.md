Glenn's Gases & Gases Framework
============

Gases Framework: An utility for adding gases like the ones seen in Glenn's Gases. The Gases framework contains the basic tools used for processing gas, but only one gas type, smoke. Using the Gases Framework only will not include the features of Glenn's Gases.

Glenn's Gases: A Minecraft mod that takes use of the Gases Framework to add several gases into the game, with special properties and reactions.

The code contained in this repository is made for Minecraft version 1.6.4, with Minecraft Forge installed.

To start developing with the Gases Framework, you must copy the source of the Gases Framework from here into your project, and optionally copy the source code of Glenn's Gases as a reference mod.

If you wish to publish your mod, you should ensure that all material from the Gases Framework and Glenn's Gases is separated from your mod file. Gases Framework should use it's own mod files as other mods might be using this framework. Feel free to distribute Gases Framework with your mod as separate mod files in your download.
